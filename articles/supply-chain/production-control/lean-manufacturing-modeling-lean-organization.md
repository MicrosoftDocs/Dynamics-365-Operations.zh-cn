<span data-ttu-id="5cced-104">文本提供有关建模精益组织的重要概念的信息。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-104">The article provides information about the key concepts in modeling a lean organization.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-105">通常，lean manufacturing 通常不只是不相关的看板规则或材料供应策略的集合。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-105">Typically, a lean manufacturing scenario is more than just a collection of unrelated kanban rules or material supply policies.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-106">材料和产品在整个工作单元中的流动以及特定生产或供应方案的位置可描述为流程或传输活动的一个序列或小型网络。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-106">The flow of material and products throughout work cells and locations for a specific production or supply scenario can be described as a sequence or small network of process or transfer activities.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-107">此序列或网络称为生产流。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-107">This sequence or network is known as a production flow.</span></span>

## <a name="production-flows-in-lean-manufacturing"></a><span data-ttu-id="5cced-108">lean manufacturing 中的生产流</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-108">Production flows in lean manufacturing</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="5cced-109">在基于生产订单的生产方案中，可将材料发给特定的生产订单。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-109">In production scenarios that are based on production orders, material is issued to a specific production order.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-110">在基于物料清单 (BOM) 和工艺路线一系列工序期间，制造产品，并最终在提供的位置接收产品。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-110">During a sequence of operations that is based on a bill of materials (BOM) and routes, products are created and are finally received at the supplied location.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-111">生产订单的吞吐量时间从数分钟到数周不等。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-111">The throughput time of production orders varies from minutes to weeks.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-112">所有相关成本、材料和人工都在生产订单上累计。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-112">All related cost, material, and labor are accumulated on the production order.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-113">为了缩短交货提前期和减少批量生产导致的工作中心之间的过量库存，lean manufacturing 在制造和仓库补货中引入了看板补货和看板超市。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-113">To reduce the delivery lead times and excess inventory between work centers that batch production causes, lean manufacturing introduces kanban replenishment and supermarkets in manufacturing and warehouse replenishment.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-114">通常，这些功能会中断部分独立的看板周期的生产。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-114">Typically, these features disrupt the production of partially independent kanban cycles.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-115">针对半成品的看板补货不再由成品的订单触发。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-115">The replenishment of a kanban for a semi-finished product is no longer triggered by an order for a finished product.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-116">为了为建议的各种看板方案重新建立生产和成本上下文，我们引入了基于活动的生产流程以作为 lean manufacturing 的支柱。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-116">To re-establish a production and cost context for the various kanban scenarios that are proposed, activity-based production flows have been introduced as the backbone of lean manufacturing.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-117">所有看板规则都引用了此预定义结构。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-117">All kanban rules refer to this predefined structure.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-118">这个基于活动的模型支持设置各种方案。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-118">The activity-based model supports the setup of a wide range of scenarios.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-119">不过，由于所有方案使用相同的基于活动的用户界面，此模型不会为车间工作人员增加复杂性。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-119">However, this model doesn't add complexity for the shop floor workers, because all scenarios use the same activity-based user interface.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-121">Lean Manufacturing 将库产品和半成品整合到单个框架中，从而为所有案例提供统一的用户体验。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-121">Lean manufacturing integrates kanbans for inventoried products and semi-finished products in a single framework, and therefore offers a unified user experience for all cases.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-122">由于此体系结构，附加的物料清单层将不再需要引入以启用用于半成品的看板。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-122">Because of this architecture, additional BOM levels no longer have to be introduced to enable kanbans to be used for semi-finished products.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-123">此体系结构还有助于使库存交易记录缩减为最小数量。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-123">This architecture also helps reduce inventory transactions to a minimum.</span></span>

## <a name="products-and-material-in-work-in-progress"></a><span data-ttu-id="5cced-124">正在处理中的产品和材料</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-124">Products and material in work in progress</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="5cced-125">如果每个领料流程或看板登记都生成了消耗的物料的交易记录，那么将批次大小减小至 lean manufacturing 中的单件流的理想状态可能导致库存交易记录显著增加。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-125">The reduction of batch sizes to the ideal state of a single piece flow in lean manufacturing can cause a dramatic increase in inventory transactions if each picking process or kanban registration causes transactions for the consumed items.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-126">生产流体系结构允许将材料随贮存或运输物料处理单元大小中的领料看板一起转移到生产流。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-126">The production flow architecture allows for the transfer of material to the production flow, together with the withdrawal kanbans in storage or transport handling unit sizes.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-127">发放的物料的值将加到与生产流相关的在制品 (WIP) 帐户中。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-127">The value of the issued material is added to the work in progress (WIP) account that is related to the production flow.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-128">此行为类似于发放到生产订单的物料的行为。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-128">This behavior resembles the behavior for material that is issued to a production order.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-129">同一原则适用于产品和半成品。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-129">The same principle can be applied to products and semi-finished products.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-130">除非这些产品是在生产流中创建、转移或消耗的，否则库存交易记录是可选的。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-130">Unless these products are created, transferred, or consumed within a production flow, inventory transactions are optional.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-131">当产品过帐到库存后，生产流的 WIP 帐户将减去相关的标准成本，从而变小。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-131">After the products are posted to inventory, the WIP account for the production flow is reduced by deducting by the related standard cost.</span></span>

## <a name="value-streams-and-value-stream-mapping"></a><span data-ttu-id="5cced-132">价值流和价值流映射</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-132">Value streams and value stream mapping</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="5cced-133">Lean Manufacturing 的体系结构的灵感来源于 Womack 和 Jones 提出的 5 大精益原则：客户价值、价值流、流动、拉动和尽善尽美。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-133">The architecture of Lean manufacturing is inspired by the five Lean principles that were formulated by Womack and Jones: Customer value, Value stream, flow, pull, and perfection.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-134">在现实制造世界中，实施 lean manufacturing 解决方案的一个久经考验的方法是价值流映射 (VSM)。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-134">One approved method for implementing lean manufacturing solutions in the physical world of manufacturing is value stream mapping (VSM).</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-135">此方法由 Rother 和 Shook 在其 Lean Manufacturing 研究所出版物《学会观察》中引入。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-135">This method was introduced by Rother and Shook in their publication “Learning to See” at the Lean Manufacturing Institute.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-136">未来状态价值流可建模为生产流版本。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-136">The future-state value stream can be modeled as a production flow version.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-137">价值流的所有流程都将建模为流度活动。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-137">All processes of the value stream are modeled as process activities.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-138">如果必须登记转移状态或者需要到库存领料或合并装运的集成，那么移动或转移可建模为转移活动。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-138">Movements or transfers can be modeled as transfer activities if the transfer status must be registered, or if integration with inventory picking or consolidated shipments is required.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-139">价值流本身将建模为运营单位。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-139">The value stream itself is modeled as an operating unit.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="5cced-140">因此，价值流可以用作财务维度。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-140">Therefore, the value stream can be used as a financial dimension.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="5cced-141">有关运营单位的详细信息，请参阅[创建运营单位](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/tasks/create-operating-unit.md)。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5cced-141">For more information about operating units, see [Create an operating unit](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/tasks/create-operating-unit.md).</span></span>
